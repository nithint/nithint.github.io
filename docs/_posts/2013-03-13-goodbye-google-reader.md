**Update:** Switched to [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com "Feedly") instead. It automatically syncs all of your google reader subscriptions.
Easiest transition ever.

Google Reader has been one of those apps that I used several times every
day. You'll be missed. Looking for alternatives but Pulse looks very
interesting and has a chrome plugin.

My stats from 5 years. Suddently realized I read a lot of news!
