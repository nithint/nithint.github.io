I'm in Seattle for a 4-day training course on AWS at Amazon and the
weather here is a sunny 75 degrees. Today was the first day of training,
I learned a lot of good information, had a good lunch and walked back to
hotel. For dinner, coworkers and I decide to walk to the nearest Thai
restaurant. Everything was going great. I ordered a Tum Kha soup. After
eating the worst Thai food I've ever had, we walk back to hotel while
foolishly looking at South Lake Union and not at the path ahead.

I entered the hotel elevator and another guy in the elevator walks away
from me to the back wall of the elevator. Then I look down at the floor
and notice something there. I lift my shoe up and aaah, there is what
can only be human feces all over it. It couldn't be dog shit cause there
was just too much of it. I limped over to my room and spent the next
half hour cleaning up the shoe.

Now I sit here washing down this day with some good lemon tea and musing
about the piece of shit that's still lying on the floor of the hotel
elevator. I should really call the front desk and tell them about it. I
now also regret not paying tip yesterday at the dirty Indian restaurant
where I ate dinner; at least their food tasted okay.

Here's hoping the rest of the trip will be more uneventful - Manchester
United vs. Sounders!!
